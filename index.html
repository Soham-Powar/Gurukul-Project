            <p style="font-size: larger; color: #db5e0e;">Why ‘Gurukul’ system of education?</p>


            Gurukul students are polite and orderly. They are taught to follow a well-planned schedule at
            school.
            Learners are more focused than ordinary students. This is because they are trained in
            meditation-like techniques that enhance their concentration.
            In gurukul, students are taught to respect everyone regardless of race, religion, ethnicity,
            culture, religion and way of looking at things. As a result, such students grow up to be very
            well-mannered and morally sound.
            The ‘guru-shishya parampara’ is an important part of Gurukul. Here the students have deep respect
            for their teachers and enjoy a good relationship with them. They were formed under the direction of
            their counsellors.
            In gurukul, the ‘guru's’ also take full responsibility for their ‘shishya's’. They share their
            experiences, inculcate good habits, and shape students' character in a positive way.
            Gurukul students are taught to appreciate the environment. Therefore, they are very close to nature.
            They worship nature and learn many things from it.
            Students are spiritually elevated which gives them a hopeful, calm and composed personality.

            and
            between the earth and the sun. The distance between the moon and the earth is 108 times the diameter of
            the
            moon similarly, the distance between the earth and the sun is 108 times the diameter of the sun.
