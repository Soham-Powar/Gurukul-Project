Gurukul Project Website
Developed during my first-year summer internship (May-July 2024) for the Vijayalaxmi Charitable Trust, Kolhapur, this project involved creating the official website for the "Gurukul" initiative. Leveraging HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript, I built a responsive and user-friendly frontend project.
This was my first major web development project.
